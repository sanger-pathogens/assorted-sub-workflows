# Assorted Sub-Workflows: a compendium of Nextflow modules for PaM Informatics bioinformatics pipelines

the following workflows are included, and can be integrated to any pipeline, in particular those maintained by the PaM Informatics team at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

Usage and default parameters of each workflow is documented separately in their respective schema and config files.

## Combined input

the `COMBINED_INPUT` workflow enables to input short sequencing reads to your pipeline in multiple ways, which may be combined.


### Using read files already on disk

Input sequencing reads can be specified through a manifest file listing paths to pairs of fastq files. Manifests of read file paths can be supplied as an argument to `--manifest_of_reads` ; this manifest should be of the following format:
```
ID,R1,R2
genomeidA,/mydata/inputs/genomeidA_1.fastq.gz,/mydata/inputs/genomeidA_2.fastq.gz
genomeidB,/mydata/inputs/genomeidB_1.fastq.gz,/mydata/inputs/genomeidB_2.fastq.gz
```

Validation of the input manifest format occurs using the `INPUT_CHECK` subworkflow.

### Retrieving reads from iRODS

This input pathway relies on the   

Sequencing data that was produced at the Wellcome Sanger Institute is natively stored on the iRODS platform, from where it can be readily obtained using `IRODS_EXTRACTOR` subworkflow and its components `IRODS_QUERY` and `CRAM_EXTRACT`.  
Data can be queried from iRODS using all sorts of metadata fields that refer to specifics of the sequencing experiment and data to be retrieved.  
In practice, the user will usually rely on the core fields that define the "lane" id, or more correctly the lanelet id e.g. `48106_1#34`. These key fields are named (in the iRODS context): `study_id`, `id_run`, `lane` and `tag_index`; in the present context these properties were renamed for convenience as `studyid`, `runid`, `laneid` and `plexid`.  
Other search terms are supported however; see below.  

These search terms are used to build a query on iRODS that will select a dataset by restricting it to data objects (stored files) that match the parameter values. Each parameter restricts the set of data files that match and will be downloaded; when omitted, samples for all possible values of that parameter are retrieved.

#### Through the command-line arguments

The selected set of data files must be defined by a combination of the following CLI parameter options: `--studyid`, `--runid`, `--laneid`, `--plexid`, `--target` and `--type`, or through specification of the corresponding pipeline parameters through a Nextflow config file (passed with `-c` option).  

At least one of `studyid` or `runid` parameters must be specified. `laneid`, `plexid`, `target` and `type` are optional parameters that can be provided only in combination with `studyid` or `runid`; if these are specified without defining a `studyid` or `runid`, the request will be ignored (no iRODS data or metadata download) with a warning - this condition aims to avoid indiscriminate download of thousands of files across all possible runs.  

You can use a syntax like the below to specify a data set of reads present on iRODS (in this example, the workflow is being summoned by Nextflow pipeline called mypipeline):
```
mypipeline --studyid 7289 --runid 48106 --laneid 1 --plexid 34
```

#### Through a manifest of lane identifiers or other metadata terms
If you wish to retrieve multiple studies/runs at the same time, you can use the option `--manifest_of_lanes` to supply a manifest of lanes listing different combinations of the above iRODS metadata fields.

An example CSV with a few valid parameter combinations:
```
studyid,runid,laneid,plexid
7289,48106,1,36 
7289,48106,2,
,48106,,35
,48106,2,
```

Each row will result into a separate query to IRODS server.  
Note that some of these rows result in overlapping queries; while some files might be requested several times, but the irods extractor workflow should only output one iteration of each file.  
Also, it is worth noting that iRODS querying can be some slow, and that it is more efficient to do fewer queries that match several files instead of many queies , one for each read file set.

The order of parameters fields in the CSV is not relevant, but the user needs to specify at least one of the `studyid` or `runid` fields; leaving a parameter field blank means data matching all possible values will be selected. Again, `laneid` and `plexid` can only be used in combination with `studyid` or `runid`, or other fields - this is a rule we introduce to prevent accidental mass download that would ensue from not specifying the run. Â  
Similarly, one cannot submit an iRODS query solely based on `target` or `type` metadata tags, as this query would catch too many file objects.
For instance, these parameter combinations are invalid (run id not specified where lane or plex ids were) and will be ignored (no data or metadata download) with a warning:
```
studyid,runid,laneid,plexid,type,target
,,1,36,,
,,1,36,,0
,,,,bam,
```

Finally, using a manifest enables the saerch of a wider set of metadata fields, namely all metadata fields featured in the iRODS database system, as defined under the Dublin Core standard; see [here](https://github.com/wtsi-npg/irods-metadata/blob/master/irods_sample_metadata.md).

in parctice, you can thus query samples based on attributes such as the organism they were collected from; this would be using the `sample_common_name` field, e.g.:  
```
sample_common_name,type
Romboutsia lituseburensis,cram
```
Note that, due to the large number of possible search terms used, no restriction rule is applied when using native iRODS search terms, so please be cautious when using this as it could result in very many file output (which might be what you desire!).

The workflow should issue a notice of how many files are considered for download, which may allow you to stop it in time if you get scared of the numbers.
